# Project Title 
Data analytics portfolio Project

## Overview 

Data analytics portfolio is your secret weapon when applying for potential positions. It should not only show off your skills and experience but give your interviewers insight into how you tackle data analytics problems. Your portfolio should highlight to hiring managers how you thought about, worked through, and visualized your results. In this final portfolio project, you’ll use your understanding of data analytics and visualization to answer a question about a topic of your choosing.
